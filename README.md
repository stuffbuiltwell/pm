Modern project and task management tools are really annoying. This is an
experiment in building a better one.

## Goals

- Minimize meta-work. A common complaint about JIRA is that it consumes an
  entire full-time IC to operate.
- Integrate well with existing tools. GitHub Projects and Issues are garbage,
  but we still need to integrate seamlessly with them because we build open
  source products.
- Capture more than just software tickets. People often wear many hats at the
  same time. Ideally, these hats do not require different tools.
- Protect focus workers from interruptions. Constant interruption and
  context-switching makes focused work like software engineering very difficult.
- Be productive as an individual. Individuals often want flexible, ad-hoc
  organization tools that can capture many kinds of tasks and suit their
  workflow.
- Be productive as a team. Teams need to balance the need for structured
  communication with ease of use.
